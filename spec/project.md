In many projects, tasks must be regularly assigned to employees, rooms, or other resources. This is often done manually using spreadsheets or various individual tools. As a result, there is frequently a lack of overview regarding who is available when, which resources are already at full capacity, or where overlaps occur. This leads to double bookings, overloads, and high organizational effort.

The Resource Manager is designed to solve this problem. The web application serves as a central point of contact to clearly record and schedule resources and tasks. Users should be able to see at a glance which resources are available, their current workload, and where potential conflicts arise.

Task Creation: As a project manager, I want to be able to record tasks with a start/end date, effort, and priority in order to plan them afterwards.

Manual Assignment: As a project manager, I want to be able to assign tasks to specific resources to determine who or what takes on which task.

Automated Assignment: As a project manager, I want to have the option to have tasks automatically assigned to suitable resources based on availability and qualifications to reduce manual planning effort.

Conflict Warning: As a project manager, I want to be warned if a resource is overloaded or double-booked to avoid scheduling conflicts in a timely manner.

Conflict Resolution Suggestions: As a project manager, I want to be suggested alternative resources or time periods when conflicts are detected, so that I can quickly find a sensible solution.

Priority-Based Scheduling: As a project manager, I want tasks with higher priority to be scheduled preferentially and lower-priority tasks to be shifted logically when no suitable resources are available, ensuring that important tasks are completed on time.

Visual Overview: As a project manager, I want to see all tasks and resources in a Calendar or Gantt view to quickly oversee the schedule. The view's time period should be variable.

Utilization View: As a project manager, I want to see the utilization of each resource over a variable time period to identify bottlenecks early.
